When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you want to collaborate a work with others

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because you might want to manage your versions separately from the one on origin while collaborating.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are ones you cloned from other repositories leaving the originals there, so it is like clones having originals someother place. Clones are ones you downloaded from your own repositories on your GitHub or your local, so they share the same origin. Branches are ones you have on your own history of commits.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

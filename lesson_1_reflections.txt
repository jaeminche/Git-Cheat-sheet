How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    On Git Bash, you can put diff -u game_old.js game_new.js. to compare files

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Having easy access to the entire history of a file lets you save your time.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    You could subjectify the saving procedure more according to each user's coding behavior.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    When you work on somehting big, you can break it into pieces and take the process by step by step.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Use 'git log' to view the history of changes of files, nd use 'git diff first_id second_id' to compare the two.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It is a risk taker! It lets you go back to the previous stage before any bugs may occur

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Use repositories
